# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore the factors influencing passenger survival rates during the infamous sinking of the RMS Titanic. The analysis employs data visualization techniques and summary statistics to uncover insights about the passengers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which is publicly available and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Objectives
- To determine the survival rates of different passenger groups.
- To identify key factors that influenced survival, such as age, gender, and class.
- To visualize the data for better understanding and presentation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash


cd titanic-survival-analysis
Run the analysis script:
bash
python titanic_analysis.py

Results:
The analysis provides visualizations and insights into survival rates based on various passenger attributes. Key findings include:
Women and children had higher survival rates compared to men.
First-class passengers had a significantly higher chance of survival than those in second and third classes.

Conclusion:
The Titanic Survival Analysis project highlights the impact of socio-economic factors on survival rates. The insights gained from this analysis can inform further studies on disaster response and passenger safety.
